Root Mean Squared Error(RMS) fully-connected model
    Model Parameters
	- Fully conneczted, c = 1
	- 20 spins, n = 20
	- No external field, J0 = 0
	- J_th = J = beta (?)

    Compute RMS error in mean values for exact-bp & exact-mf
	- For each β, estimate the RMS errors in multiple random instances of the Ising model and compute the mean and std 
	- Plot the RMS errors (mean and standard deviation) as a function of β for 0 < β ≤ 2. 
	- Find that the algorithms converge in several hundred iterations using smoothing η = 0.5.
	- Compare to ./bp_mf_exact fig 1

    Compute RMS error in  correlations for exact-bp & exact-mf
	- Get correlation MF using linear correction
	- Get correlation BP by using formula given and joint probablity after convergence
	For each β: 0 < β ≤ 2, in multiple random instances of Ising model calculate:
	    - RMS error cor(exact) - cor(MF)
	    - RMS error cor(exact) - cor(BP)
	- Compute mean and STD(?)
	- Plot the RMS errors (mean and standard deviation) as a function of β for 0 < β ≤ 2. (see fig1)
